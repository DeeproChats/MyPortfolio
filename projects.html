                <h2>üîç Malware Detection using Machine Learning</h2>
                <p><br>I led a cybersecurity-focused project that leverages machine learning to detect and classify malware efficiently.<br> The system was designed to analyze malicious files through feature extraction and behavioral patterns, significantly improving detection accuracy.<br>
                    For implementation, I used Python, employing Scikit-Learn, and Streamlit to process malware datasets.<br> By extracting features from both static and dynamic file analysis, the model could differentiate between benign and malicious files with high precision.<br>
                    This project enhances cybersecurity by reducing false positives and automating the malware detection process, making it a valuable tool for security teams and researchers.</p>

                <h2>üìù Video Note-Making AI (Gemini API & FFmpeg)</h2>
                <p><br>I developed a Streamlit-based AI-powered web application that simplifies note-taking from YouTube videos. The app extracts audio from videos using FFmpeg, transcribes it, and processes it with the Gemini API to generate structured notes.<br>
                    The system enables users to quickly extract key insights from long-form video content, making it an ideal tool for students and researchers.<br> With a clean and interactive Streamlit interface, users can efficiently review important points without manually taking notes.<br>
                    This project demonstrates the power of AI-driven automation in education, helping learners save time and retain information more effectively.</p>

                <h2>üìÑ Resume Parser (Hugging Face API)</h2>
                <p><br>I built a Flask-based resume parsing system that automates applicant screening using Natural Language Processing (NLP). The project utilizes the Hugging Face API to extract structured data from resumes, such as skills, education, and work experience.<br>
                    The web-based interface, designed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allows users to upload resumes and view the extracted data in an organized format.<br> It also supports keyword-based filtering, enabling recruiters to identify top candidates efficiently.<br>
                    This project significantly streamlines the hiring process, reducing manual resume screening time while ensuring accurate data extraction for better decision-making.</p>

                <h2>üåû Smart Street Solar Light Systems (LUMOS)</h2>
                <p><br>I contributed to an IoT-integrated smart lighting project, focusing on developing and debugging a web-based control system for automated solar street lights.<br> The system was implemented using Java (Eclipse) and optimized for real-time monitoring.<br>
                    By integrating sensor-based automation, the project enabled streetlights to adjust brightness dynamically based on ambient light and motion detection. My role involved improving system efficiency and ensuring seamless performance.<br>
                    This project enhances urban infrastructure by optimizing energy consumption, reducing maintenance costs, and promoting smart city development.</p>
